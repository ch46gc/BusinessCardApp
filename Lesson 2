What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

create new commits in the directory.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	When working on a project,  people add different features to  code, we have to add the
changes to the original code. So adding branches helps in updating the master code and saving lot of time.
It is very helpful when trying to understand the concept. It also gives us an idea
of changes we make.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	 When a particular function  is different in both of the branches. If this is not the case it can merge the code
automatically.  Manual merging comes into effect. It is always good to do it manually.
